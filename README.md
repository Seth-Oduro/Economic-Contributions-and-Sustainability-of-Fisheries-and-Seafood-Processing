Date:  16th February 2025

## Abstract
This study examines the economic contributions of Wild Fisheries, Recreational Fishing, and Seafood Processing in British Columbia from 2010 to 2020, focusing on revenue, GDP, labour income, and employment. Using input-output multipliers from Statistics Canada’s industry classifications, the research quantifies the direct, indirect, and induced economic impacts over two periods: 2010-2015 and 2015-2019. The findings show that Seafood Processing dominates, contributing 50.6% ($447.3 billion) of total industry revenue and 45.6% ($398.8 billion) of GDP in 2019. Wild Fisheries contributed 32.3% ($285.5 billion) to revenue and 31.4% ($274.5 billion) to GDP, while Recreational Fishing accounted for 17.1% ($151.2 billion) of revenue and 23% ($201 billion) of GDP, reflecting its role in tourism and regional economies.
Labour income and employment trends highlight sectoral differences in workforce engagement. Seafood Processing led with 55.3% ($207.08 billion) of total labour income, followed by Wild Fisheries at 29.3% ($109.63 billion) and Recreational Fishing at 15.4% ($57.46 billion). Employment declined between 2010-2015 and 2015-2019, with Seafood Processing employing 46.2% of total jobs (3.7 million FTEs), Recreational Fishing 30.8% (2.46 million FTEs), and Wild Fisheries 23% (1.85 million FTEs). These findings suggest automation, industry shifts, and policy changes have influenced employment levels. The study highlights the need for policies to support sectoral resilience, employment stability, and sustainable fisheries management while optimizing economic benefits.

## Introduction
### Background
The ocean plays a crucial role in Earth's ecosystem, covering over 70% of the planet's surface and providing essential ecosystem services such as food, climate regulation, carbon sequestration, and cultural value (Costanza et al., 1997; Hoegh-Guldberg, 2015). It is a key driver of global trade, economic development, and the cultural identity of maritime communities (Teh, Cheung, & Sumaila, 2022). However, oceans are increasingly threatened by pollution, overfishing, biodiversity loss, and climate change, which jeopardize their productivity and the benefits they provide to society (Worm et al., 2006; Allison & Bassett, 2015). To address these challenges, the blue economy has emerged as a framework for sustainable ocean-based economic activities, including fisheries, aquaculture, tourism, shipping, and offshore energy (OECD, 2016; Ebarvia, 2016). This approach seeks to balance economic growth with sustainability, ensuring ocean resources benefit current and future generations, while aligning with global sustainability goals such as UN Sustainable Development Goal 14 (Life Below Water) (Patil et al., 2019; UN General Assembly, 2015).
Despite the ocean’s economic importance, assessing its contributions remains a challenge due to data-intensive and specialized methodologies that limit accessibility for policymakers and resource managers (Teh et al., 2022). This lack of accessibility hinders informed decision-making and effective ocean resource management. To bridge this gap, this study develops a pragmatic framework for assessing the economic contribution of ocean-based activities, using British Columbia’s Pacific Coast as a case study. The framework is designed to be user-friendly and accessible to non-specialists, enabling rapid economic assessments across various contexts. By quantifying the economic benefits generated by ocean industries, this research aims to demonstrate the socio-economic significance of marine resources and support policies that promote sustainable ocean use (Teh et al., 2022).


### Problem Statement
The ocean is a vital economic resource, providing livelihoods, food security, and essential ecosystem services, yet its full economic value is often underestimated or overlooked in national and regional assessments (Colgan, 2017a; Ebarvia, 2016). This underrepresentation is largely due to the complexity of quantifying both market and non-market values, as well as data limitations and methodological challenges (Teh et al., 2022; Kildow & McIlgorm, 2010). While efforts have been made to measure the economic contributions of ocean-based industries, these assessments are often sector-specific or geographically constrained, limiting their applicability in broader economic planning.
In British Columbia, the ocean supports key industries, including fisheries, aquaculture, marine transportation, and tourism, despite the economic significance of these industries, existing research lacks an integrated approach that quantifies their total economic contributions and evaluates trends across multiple economic indicators. The absence of detailed sectoral assessments hinders policymakers and industry stakeholders from making informed decisions regarding sustainable fisheries management, value-added production strategies, and labour market policies. Without a data-driven approach, the long-term economic viability of these industries remains uncertain. This research aims to fill these knowledge gaps by analyzing historical data from 2010 to 2020, applying input-output economic modeling, and assessing trends in revenue, GDP, employment, and labour income to provide actionable insights for industry resilience and sustainability.

## Literature Review

### Economic Contributions of Ocean-Based Activities
The economic significance of ocean-based activities has been extensively studied, particularly in regions where marine industries play a crucial role in economic growth. Studies often assess the gross value added (GVA), employment, and total output generated by ocean sectors (Colgan, 2017a; Kildow & McIlgorm, 2010). In the United States, the ocean economy contributes over $300 billion to GDP, supporting millions of jobs, with fisheries, marine tourism, and shipping being key industries (Colgan, 2017b). Similarly, in the East Asian Seas, ocean-based activities significantly impact national economies, particularly in China, Indonesia, and South Korea, where fisheries and maritime industries dominate (Ebarvia, 2016). However, in British Columbia (BC), Canada, comprehensive economic assessments of ocean sectors remain outdated, limiting policymakers' ability to make informed decisions (Teh et al., 2022).

### Challenges in Assessing the Ocean Economy
Assessing the economic contributions of ocean-based activities presents numerous challenges due to the complexity of market and non-market values (Teh et al., 2022). Traditional economic assessments focus on direct use values, such as fishing, aquaculture, and marine tourism, but often exclude indirect and non-use values, including ecosystem services like carbon sequestration, biodiversity preservation, and coastal protection (Nunes & van den Bergh, 2001; Remoundou et al., 2009). Additionally, data limitations and the exclusion of indirect and induced effects result in underestimations of the total economic value of the ocean economy (Colgan, 2017a; Kildow & McIlgorm, 2010). The complexity of capturing intangible benefits and ecosystem services further complicates economic assessments, making it difficult to convey the true economic importance of ocean industries (Pascual et al., 2010).

### The Need for Simplified Economic Assessment Frameworks
Given the challenges in traditional economic assessments, there is a growing need for simplified frameworks that can provide accessible, rapid economic evaluations for policymakers and stakeholders. Recent work by Teh et al. (2022) has developed a framework for assessing the economic contributions of ocean-based activities in British Columbia, which categorizes ocean sectors based on their physical connections to the ocean and their societal benefits. This framework enables the estimation of sector revenue, GDP, labour income, and employment, making economic assessments more practical and adaptable to different regional contexts (Ebarvia, 2016). By adopting such models, governments and organizations can improve decision-making in ocean resource management and enhance the sustainability of marine-based industries.


## Methodology and Materials

### Study Area and Scope
This study examines the economic contributions of three key ocean-based industries Wild Fisheries, Recreational Fishing, and Seafood Processing in British Columbia, Canada. The analysis focuses on the period 2010 to 2020, estimating the direct, indirect, and induced economic impacts of these sectors on revenue, GDP, labour income, and employment (FTE jobs). The study employs input-output economic modeling to assess the multiplier effects of these industries on the economy.

### Data Sources
The data for this study were obtained from multiple sources:

    Statistics Canada Input-Output Tables – Used to derive sector-specific multipliers for revenue, GDP, labour income, and employment.
    Sea Around Us Database – Provided data on wild fisheries, recreational fishery including total catch (tonnes) and ex-vessel fish prices.
    Government and Industry Reports – Used to collect seafood processing economic data, including landed fish values and processing margins.

### Data Extraction and Processing
Selection of Industries and Variables

    •	Wild Fisheries: Measured as capture fisheries from industrial and artisanal sources, measured using landed value and total catch.
    •	Recreational Fishing: Includes both resident and non-resident participation, measured through expenditure per angler and total catch.
    •	Seafood Processing: Refers to the post-harvest sector, estimated using wholesale value and processing margins to derive economic contributions.
    
The following economic indicators were selected:

    •	Output (Total Revenue)
    •	Gross Domestic Product (GDP) at Market Prices
    •	Labour Income (Wages and Salaries)
    •	Jobs (Full-time Equivalent Employment)

### Methodological Approach
#### Input-Output Economic Modeling
1.	Revenue Estimation:

        Wild Fisheries: Total Catch × Ex-vessel Price
        Seafood Processing: Landed Fish Value + Processing Margin
        Recreational Fishing: Expenditure Per Angler × Estimated Catch

2.	Economic Impact Estimation:

        Each sector’s revenue is multiplied by GDP, labour income, and employment multipliers to compute direct, indirect, and induced effects.
        Total contributions are aggregated by year and across industry classifications.

3.	Period-Based Analysis:

        Data is grouped into two periods: 2010-2015 and 2015-2019.
        Economic contributions are assessed over time to track changes in sectoral performance.

Note: Since recreational fishing expenditure data was available only for 2015, these values were extrapolated across all years (2010-2020) to maintain consistency in the analysis.

The revenue trends over time for Recreational Fishing, Wild Fishery, and Seafood Processing reveal distinct patterns in economic contributions and growth. Seafood Processing exhibits the highest revenue, surpassing $3 trillion by 2020, showing consistent growth post-1990, likely due to technological advancements, increased export demand, and higher value-added activities. In contrast, Recreational Fishing revenue has steadily increased without major fluctuations, reaching nearly $1.5 trillion by 2020, indicating strong industry resilience, driven by stable participation and tourism growth. Wild Fisheries, however, exhibit significant fluctuations, with revenue rising post-1980 but showing periodic downturns, suggesting the impact of regulatory measures, and environmental constraints.
A comparative analysis highlights that while Seafood Processing dominates total economic output, Recreational Fishing provides stability, and Wild Fisheries are more sensitive to policy and environmental factors. Seafood Processing consistently outperforms the other sectors in revenue, reinforcing its role as a key economic driver. However, Recreational Fishing maintains steady growth, likely due to less direct regulatory intervention and stable consumer demand. The volatility in Wild Fisheries revenue contrasts with the steady upward trends in the other two sectors, emphasizing the sector’s dependency on external factors such as quotas, sustainability policies, and climate change effects.

In GDP contributions, Seafood Processing leads with 45.6% ($398.8 billion), emphasizing global trade linkages and higher economic multipliers. Wild Fisheries contribute 31.4% ($274.5 billion) as a primary seafood source, though with lower value-added potential. Recreational Fishing accounts for 23% ($201 billion), highlighting its indirect economic impact on tourism and retail. These findings suggest that Seafood Processing drives the highest economic value, while Wild Fisheries and Recreational Fishing maintain essential roles despite revenue limitations.
The labour income and employment trends provide further insights into sectoral differences. Seafood Processing leads in labour income (55.3% or $207.08 billion) and employment (46.2% or 3.7 million jobs), emphasizing its labour-intensive nature and wage-generating potential. Wild Fisheries contributed 29.3% ($109.63 billion) to labour income but employed only 23% of workers, reflecting higher average wages in capital-intensive operations. Recreational Fishing had the lowest labour income share (15.4% or $57.46 billion) but employed more workers (30.8%) than Wild Fisheries, suggesting that it supports a large number of lower-wage, seasonal, or part-time jobs. The analysis highlights Seafood Processing as the dominant economic driver, while Wild Fisheries and Recreational Fishing contribute significantly to employment and regional economic stability.

The employment chart shows a noticeable drop in job creation, particularly in induced effects, which suggests fewer indirect jobs supported by industry spending. This decline may be due to automation, industry consolidation, or shifting labour demands in seafood processing and fisheries. The revenue decline mirrors the trends in GDP and labour income, reinforcing the notion that the industry has contracted over time. Despite the decline, the proportionate distribution of direct, indirect, and induced effects remained stable, highlighting that while total contributions have fallen, the economic structure of the industry has remained unchanged. These findings emphasize the need for policy interventions to enhance industry resilience, improve workforce stability, and support sustainable fisheries management to maintain long-term economic viability.

## Discussions
The economic analysis of Wild Fisheries, Recreational Fishing, and Seafood Processing in British Columbia reveals significant insights into the contributions and challenges of these industries. The findings indicate that Seafood Processing dominates total revenue (50.6%) and GDP (45.6%), highlighting its role as the most economically impactful sector due to value-added processing and global trade linkages. Wild Fisheries, contributing 32.3% of total revenue and 31.4% of GDP, demonstrate moderate economic strength but remain vulnerable to quota regulations, stock availability, and environmental policies. Recreational Fishing, though the smallest in revenue (17.1%), holds a relatively high GDP share (23%), emphasizing its importance to the tourism and service industries.
Labour income and employment trends show disparities in workforce engagement across the three sectors. Seafood Processing accounts for the highest labour income (55.3%) and employment (46.2%), reflecting its labour-intensive nature and role in job creation. Recreational Fishing employs a larger workforce (30.8%) than Wild Fisheries (23%) but at lower wages, as the industry relies more on seasonal and part-time employment. The findings also show a decline in GDP, labour income, and employment between 2010-2015 and 2015-2019, suggesting the effects of automation, industry consolidation, and shifting market dynamics. Despite these declines, the overall structure of economic contributions remains stable, reinforcing the need for strategic policy interventions to sustain industry growth and workforce stability.

## Limitations
This study has several limitations that should be considered when interpreting the findings. Data gaps and extrapolation issues exist, particularly with Recreational Fishing, where only 2015 data were available, requiring extrapolation across the study period. This introduces potential inaccuracies in trend analysis. Additionally, the use of fixed input-output multipliers from Statistics Canada assumes constant economic relationships over time, which may not fully capture technological advancements, policy changes, or efficiency improvements in the industry.
The study also does not account for external factors such as global market fluctuations, trade policies, or environmental disruptions, which could significantly impact the fisheries and seafood processing sectors. The sectoral scope is limited to Wild Fisheries, Recreational Fishing, and Seafood Processing, excluding other important ocean-related industries such as marine shipping, offshore oil and gas, and aquaculture that contribute to the broader economy. Furthermore, the employment analysis does not differentiate between full-time, part-time, and seasonal jobs, potentially leading to overestimations or underestimations of workforce stability.

## Conclusion
This study provides a comprehensive assessment of the economic contributions of fisheries and seafood processing in British Columbia, offering valuable insights for policymakers and industry stakeholders. The findings confirm that Seafood Processing is the dominant driver of revenue, GDP, and employment, whereas Wild Fisheries remain subject to regulatory and environmental pressures. Recreational Fishing, though smaller in direct contributions, plays a critical role in tourism and local economies.
The observed decline in economic contributions between 2010-2015 and 2015-2019 highlight the need for policy-driven solutions to enhance sustainability, labour market stability, and economic resilience. Investments in value-added processing, sustainable fisheries management, and infrastructure development for recreational fishing could help maximize long-term benefits. Ultimately, ensuring a balanced approach between economic growth and resource conservation is essential for the sustainability of British Columbia’s ocean-based industries.
